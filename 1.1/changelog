Version 1.1 - May 11, 2013 15:41

- condensed addtext.php and cleartext.php into message.php
- security: prevented access to files outside of ../docs
- allow text to have special chars (means filenames are all escaped)
- removed send button
- added new routes for when inotify and/or server-sent events don't work
- moved ajax to a new function
- added no-cache headers to all files because IE caches and makes a mess
- made #bot height 100px
